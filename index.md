Routers vs. Switches? Switches vs. Routers? Which one to choose and why?
 A business network allows all members of your company to connect with each other, customers, business partners, important applications and the Internet. The best thing about a network is that both applications and information can be shared and that any member of your team can easily access them. Consider the following:

How do you connect to the Internet? Via network.
Where is your company's software stored? In the net.
How do several members of your team share an important presentation? Through the network.
What allows you to get important messages to your employees and business partners? Network.
What is Routing and Switching?

[Enterprise router](https://www.fieldengineer.com/blogs/top-seven-enterprise-router-vendors-consider-2018/) is a basic product for any business/enterprise.The operation of a network consists in connecting computers and peripherals through two parts of the equipment: switches and routers. These two elements allow devices connected to the network to communicate with each other and with other networks.

Although they are very similar, switches and routers perform very different functions in the network:

The switches are used to connect several devices through the same network within a building or office. For example, a switch can connect its computers, printers and servers, creating a network of shared resources. The switch would act as a controller, allowing different devices to share information and communicate with each other. By sharing information and allocating resources, switches allow you to save money and increase productivity. There are two basic types of switches: managed and unmanaged.

Unmanaged switches: They work automatically and do not allow changes. Computers in home networks often use unmanaged switches.
Managed switches: Allow programming. This provides great flexibility because the switch can be monitored and adjusted locally or remotely to give you control over the movement of traffic on the network and who has access to it.

Routers are used to connect several networks. For example, you can use a router to connect your networked computers to the Internet and, thus, share an Internet connection between multiple users. The router will act as a distributor, selecting the best route to move the information so that it receives it quickly. The routers analyze the data that is going to be sent through a network, pack it in a different way and send it to another network or through a different type of network. They connect their business with the outside world, they protect information from security threats, and they can even decide which computers have priority over others. Depending on the business and its network connection plans, you can choose between routers that include different capacities. They can include functions such as:

Firewall: Specialized software that examines incoming data and protects your business network from possible attacks.
Virtual private network (VPN): Method that allows remote employees to access your network securely.
IP telephone network: Combines the telephone network and the equipment network of your company, using voice and conference technology, to simplify and unify communications.
